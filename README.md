This project is a functional simulation of a real-world coffee machine's internal logic. It manages three main aspects of the operation: resource management (water, milk, coffee), menu selection (Espresso, Latte, Cappuccino), and a coin-operated payment system.

Key Features:

Resource Management: Monitors ingredient levels and alerts the user if resources are insufficient for a specific drink.

Transaction Processing: Calculates the total value of coins inserted (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) and handles change or refunds if the amount is insufficient.

Reporting: Includes a "report" feature to check the current status of resources and the total profit made.

Object-Oriented Design (Optional): (Note: Mention this if you used Classes/Objects) Uses OOP principles to separate the menu, coffee maker, and money machine logic.
